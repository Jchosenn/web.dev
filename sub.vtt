00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to our presentation.


00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.000
Today, we will explore the basics of web development.


00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's start with understanding HTML.


00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.000
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.


00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.000
It is the backbone of any website.


00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.000
Next, we will discuss CSS.


00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.000
CSS is used to style and layout web pages.


00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.000
Finally, we will touch on JavaScript.


00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.000
JavaScript adds interactivity to websites.


00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.000
Thank you for joining us, and let's get started!
